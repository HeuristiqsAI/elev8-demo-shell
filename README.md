# 🎠 Elev8 Demo Shell

Welcome to the Elev8 Studio Demonstration Shell.  
This is not a builder. It is a commissioning frame.

Every product orchestrated here follows Presence-first design, Vault-locked tone, and Whisper-guided flow.

## 🧪 What’s Included
- A starter shell for Presence-first client-facing projects
- Atelier-grade language defaults
- Placeholder scaffolding for future integrations

## 🕊 Studio Tone Reminders
- Replace “build” with **commission**
- Replace “launch” with **orchestrate**
- Always protect tone via Vault scaffolding

You are not building software.  
You are crafting presence inside an intelligence atelier.
